# OAuth Flow Fixed - Summary

The "Invalid client_id" issue has been fixed by ensuring all components use a single, centralized database and by providing proper OAuth client registration through a new script. Here's what was done:

## 1. Created a Centralized Database Configuration

- Standardized the database path to `./evrmore_authentication/data/evrmore_auth.db` in both `.env` file and scripts
- Modified `run_api_server.py` to use this path consistently
- Updated the SQLiteManager initialization to use the same path
- Initialized the database with the correct schema using `python3 -m scripts.db_manage init`

## 2. Created an OAuth Client Registration Script

- Created `scripts/register_oauth_client.py` for simple client management
- The script connects directly to the SQLite database to register, list, and delete clients
- It ensures consistent database usage and schema creation
- It provides easy-to-use commands with clear output

## 3. Registered a New OAuth Client

- Used the new script to register a client with:
  ```
  python3 scripts/register_oauth_client.py register \
      --name "FastAPI OAuth Example" \
      --redirects "http://localhost:8000/callback" \
      --uri "http://localhost:8000" \
      --scopes "profile,email" \
      --response-types "code"
  ```
- This generated a client ID of `d5fdcc0c-7a88-4cfc-a1ff-6af04b92e9b0`
- Created a dedicated `.env.oauth` file with the client credentials

## 4. Updated the FastAPI OAuth Example

- Modified the example to use the `.env.oauth` file for client credentials
- Added better error handling for missing OAuth settings
- Added informative logging to track which credentials are being used
- Added dotenv loading to ensure credentials are available

## 5. Verified the Solution

- Restarted the authentication server
- Tested the `/auth` endpoint which successfully recognized our client
- The authentication page now correctly shows "FastAPI OAuth Example" as the requesting application

## Using the Fixed System

To register additional OAuth clients:

1. Make sure the database is initialized:
   ```
   python3 -m scripts.db_manage init
   ```

2. Register a new client:
   ```
   python3 scripts/register_oauth_client.py register \
       --name "Your Client Name" \
       --redirects "Your-Redirect-URI"
   ```

3. Use the client credentials from the output in your application environment.

With these changes, the OAuth flow now works correctly with properly registered clients in a single, unified database.
